## Key Observations

1. **Gross Pay**: 
   - Remained constant at £75,000.00 for three consecutive years.
   - Increased by 3.5% in 2022-2023 to £77,625.00.

2. **Tax Deductions**:
   - Stable at £16,620.00 for three years.
   - Increased by 7.97% in 2022-2023, outpacing the gross pay increase.

3. **National Insurance Contributions**:
   - Showed fluctuations over the years.
   - Notably decreased by 12.68% in 2021-2022 before increasing again in 2022-2023.

## Analysis

1. **Income Stability**: Your gross pay remained stable for three years, indicating a consistent income level. The 3.5% increase in 2022-2023 suggests a positive change, potentially due to a raise or additional responsibilities.

2. **Tax Burden**: The significant increase in tax deductions (7.97%) in 2022-2023, compared to the 3.5% gross pay increase, indicates you may have moved into a higher tax bracket for part of your income.

3. **NI Contributions**: The fluctuations in NI contributions, especially the decrease in 2021-2022, could be due to changes in NI thresholds or rates. The subsequent increase in 2022-2023 aligns with the rise in gross pay.

4. **Overall Trend**: The data shows a pattern of stability followed by growth in the most recent tax year. This suggests a positive trajectory in your earnings, albeit with a proportionally higher increase in deductions.

## Conclusion

Your financial situation, as reflected in these P60s, shows stability with recent growth. The increase in gross pay in 2022-2023 is a positive sign, though it's accompanied by higher deductions. This pattern is typical as income rises, often resulting in a higher proportion of earnings being subject to tax and NI contributions.
