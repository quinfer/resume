# Personal Statement


As a Senior Lecturer in Finance, Technology, and Data Science at Queen's University Belfast, I bridge the gap between academic research and industry innovation. My work focuses on applying advanced statistical and machine learning techniques to complex problems in finance, with a particular emphasis on regulatory technology, systemic risk, and responsible AI development in financial services.

I am passionate about fostering interdisciplinary research collaborations that push the boundaries of what is possible in the field of finance. My goal is to equip the next generation of finance professionals with the knowledge and tools they'll need to succeed in a rapidly evolving digital landscape, while also instilling values of ethical decision-making and continuous learning.

Through my teaching, research, and industry engagements, I strive to contribute to the advancement of financial technology and data science, always with an eye towards practical applications and societal impact.

# Teaching

I have extensive teaching experience at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels, specialising in:

1.  **Quantitative Finance**: My teaching integrates cutting-edge quantitative techniques with practical applications in financial markets.

2.  **Ethical Econometrics**: Instructing students in econometrics as an applied statistics discipline, avoiding the statistical cavaliering that plagues the econometric publication playbook.

3.  **AI and Machine Learning in Finance**: Pioneering courses that explore the intersection of artificial intelligence and finance. Topics include machine learning for rule-based algorithmic trading, asset pricing, algorithmic trading, and AI-driven risk assessment.

## Teaching Philosophy

I help students prepare for the future of finance and technology by teaching essential skills like analysing data, making evidence-based decisions under uncertainty, and applying advanced statistical techniques to real-world financial problems. My goal is to equip them with the knowledge and tools they'll need to succeed in a rapidly evolving job market, while also fostering qualities like resilience, humility, and intellectual curiosity.

# Research

I have published thirteen peer reviewed internationally acclaimed academic papers (1 ABS4, 10 ABS3s, and 2 ABS2s), three commission research reports, and two statistical software research packages. My research lies at the intersection of finance, economics, and data science, with a focus on developing innovative analytical approaches to address complex issues in financial markets, regulation, and sustainability. My work is characterised by the application of advanced statistical, econometric, and machine learning techniques across a diverse range of financial and economic contexts.
