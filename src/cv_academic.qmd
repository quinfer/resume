# Personal Statement

Professor Barry Quinn is Professor of Finance & Financial Technology at Ulster University Business School, where he is developing the Centre for Financial and Regulatory Technology. He is an applied econometrician and Chartered Statistician whose work integrates econometrics, machine learning, and computational approaches to address challenges in financial markets, risk, and regulatory compliance.

His research combines causal policy analysis, algorithmic trading risk detection, and trustworthy AI methods, with a particular interest in how financial technology can support resilient markets and evidence-based regulation. Barry's work is collaborative and interdisciplinary, bridging economics, statistics, computer science, and law.

He teaches across quantitative finance, econometrics, and AI applications in finance, encouraging students to engage with rigorous, ethical, and reproducible methods. Pedagogically, he emphasises employability, resilience, and critical thinking.

Before entering academia, Barry worked in financial markets, specialising in currency trading and liquidity management. He holds a PhD in Finance from Queen's University Belfast, is a Chartered Statistician, and is completing an MSc in Artificial Intelligence. He actively collaborates with industry and policy partners to ensure his research delivers academic, societal, and regulatory impact.
