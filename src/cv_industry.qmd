# Executive Summary

Professor Barry Quinn is Professor of Finance & Financial Technology at Ulster University Business School and Director of the Centre for Finance and Responsible Technology. The Centre is guided by three pillars: statistical rigour and intellectual humility; practical industry relevance; and responsible algorithmic innovation. It has been established with £360K in funded PhD scholarships from the Department of the Economy (NI), including two collaborative doctoral partnerships with local firms (Pytillia and Napier AI).

Barry is a Chartered Statistician and views econometrics as an applied statistical science. He focuses on decision-relevant evidence for markets, risk, and compliance—making assumptions explicit, quantifying uncertainty, and stress-testing results before drawing conclusions. He values methods that are transparent, reproducible, and auditable in real operational settings.

Before entering academia, Barry worked in financial markets, specialising in currency trading and liquidity management. He holds a PhD in Finance and an MSc in Artificial Intelligence (Distinction) from Queen's University Belfast, and works with external partners to ensure that research translates into robust practice rather than prototypes.

**Core Value Proposition:**
- **Industry Experience**: Former currency trader and liquidity manager at Janus Henderson Investors
- **Academic Excellence**: 14 peer-reviewed publications, Chartered Statistician
- **Technology Leadership**: AI/ML expert with MSc in Artificial Intelligence (Distinction)
- **Business Impact**: £2.4M+ research funding, multiple successful industry partnerships including collaborative doctoral partnerships
