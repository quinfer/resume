# Executive Summary

Applied econometrician and Chartered Statistician working at the intersection of finance, technology, and data science. I focus on causal mechanisms beyond cookbook econometrics and on computational finance approaches‚Äînumerical methods, simulation, and agent-based modelling‚Äîto solve problems that resist closed-form analysis. My research and partnerships apply statistical, computational, and machine learning techniques to financial markets, regulatory compliance, and policy, with current teaching and delivery in Financial Data Science and causal AI. This work has been supported by UKRI/EPSRC, Innovate UK, and the Department for the Economy, and has resulted in publications in IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, International Journal of Forecasting, and Energy Economics. Prior to academia, I worked as a currency trader and liquidity manager at Janus Henderson Investors; that experience underpins a pragmatic approach to building AI- and analytics-driven solutions. I hold a PhD in Finance and am currently completing an MSc in Artificial Intelligence.

- **Academic Excellence**: 14 peer-reviewed publications, Chartered Statistician
