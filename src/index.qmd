# Personal Statement

I am Professor of Finance and FinTech at Ulster University Business School and Director of the Centre for Financial and Regulatory Technology. As an applied econometrician and Chartered Statistician, I explore the intersection of finance, technology, and data science, focusing on causal mechanisms beyond cookbook econometrics. My work also engages with computational economics and its finance counterpart, where numerical methods, simulation, and agent-based modelling are applied to problems that defy closed-form solutions.

My research applies statistical, computational, and machine learning techniques to financial markets, causal policy analysis, and cooperative finance. I have been fortunate to receive support from UKRI/EPSRC, Innovate UK, and the Department for the Economy for this work, which has resulted in publications in journals including IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, International Journal of Forecasting, and Energy Economics.

Before academia, I worked in financial markets as a currency trader and liquidity manager at Janus Henderson Investors, an experience that continues to inform my approach to financial research. I hold a PhD in Finance from Queen's University Belfast and am currently pursuing an MSc in Artificial Intelligence to better understand emerging technologies in finance.

Through my teaching in quantitative finance, econometrics, financial data science, causal AI, and AI in trading, I hope to help students develop both technical competence and ethical approaches to data analysis. By framing my work within computational finance as well as econometrics, I aim to contribute meaningfully to evidence-based decision-making in finance whilst maintaining the rigorous statistical standards expected in our field.

# Teaching

I have extensive teaching experience at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels, specialising in:

1.  **Quantitative Finance**: My teaching integrates cutting-edge quantitative techniques with practical applications in financial markets.

2.  **Financial Econometrics**: Instructing students in econometrics as an applied statistics discipline, avoiding the statistical cavaliering that plagues the econometric publication playbook.

3.  **Financial Data Science & Causal AI**: End-to-end data pipelines, feature engineering, and time-series ML, with causal inference and causal representation learning for decision support. 
   - Outcomes: reproducible ETL and feature stores, treatment-effect estimation and uplift modeling, model risk management and governance in financial settings.

## Teaching Philosophy

I help students prepare for the future of finance and technology by teaching essential skills like analysing data, making evidence-based decisions under uncertainty, and applying advanced statistical techniques to real-world financial problems. My goal is to equip them with the knowledge and tools they'll need to succeed in a rapidly evolving job market, while also fostering qualities like resilience, humility, and intellectual curiosity.

# Research

I have published fourteen peer reviewed internationally acclaimed academic papers (1 ABS4, 11 ABS3s, and 2 ABS2s), three commission research reports, and two statistical software research packages. My research lies at the intersection of finance, economics, technology and data science, with a focus on developing innovative analytical approaches to address complex issues in financial markets, regulation, and sustainability. My work is characterised by the application of advanced statistical, econometric, and machine learning techniques across a diverse range of financial and economic contexts.
