## 🔹 Medium Bio (~150–180 words)

For LinkedIn, RSS directory, conference profiles.

Professor Barry Quinn is Professor of Finance at Ulster University Business School and Director of the Centre for Finance and Responsible Technology. A Chartered Statistician, he treats econometrics as an applied statistical science: making assumptions explicit, quantifying uncertainty, and stress-testing results before drawing conclusions. His work sits at the intersection of finance, statistical learning, and responsible use of algorithms, with an emphasis on transparent methods that can be explained and audited.

He works with industry and policy partners on practical problems in markets, risk, and compliance—aiming to reduce avoidable complexity and improve decision-making with evidence that is reproducible and fit for purpose. Before academia, Barry worked in currency trading and liquidity management, experience that continues to shape his focus on operational realism. He holds a PhD in Finance and an MSc in Artificial Intelligence (Distinction).

## 🔹 Long Bio (~300–350 words)

For Ulster Pure, ORCID, personal CV/resume site, grant applications.

Professor Barry Quinn is Professor of Finance & Financial Technology at Ulster University Business School and Director of the Centre for Finance and Responsible Technology. The Centre’s work is guided by three pillars: statistical rigour and intellectual humility; practical industry relevance; and responsible algorithmic innovation. In practice, that means making assumptions explicit, quantifying uncertainty, stress-testing results, and being clear about limits—so we can say plainly when evidence does (and does not) support a confident conclusion.

Barry is a Chartered Statistician and views econometrics as an applied statistical science. His research integrates econometrics, statistical learning, and computational methods to address problems in financial markets and institutions, risk measurement, and evidence for regulation and compliance. He is particularly interested in approaches that are transparent, reproducible, and auditable, with attention to explainability, bias and fairness risks, validation and controls, and privacy.

The Centre has secured £360K in funded PhD scholarships from the Department of the Economy (NI), including two collaborative doctoral partnerships with local firms (Pytillia and Napier AI). These projects reflect the Centre’s focus on co-developing research with organisations that face real constraints—data quality, operational risk, governance, and regulatory scrutiny—so that results translate into practice rather than staying as prototypes.

Before entering academia, Barry worked in financial markets, specialising in currency trading and liquidity management. He holds a PhD in Finance and an MSc in Artificial Intelligence (Distinction) from Queen’s University Belfast. He also holds the Advanced Data Science Professional award from the Royal Statistical Society. He teaches across quantitative finance, econometrics, and AI applications in finance, emphasising ethical practice, reproducibility, and critical thinking.
