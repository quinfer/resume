abstract = {{This paper analyses return and volatility spillovers among 21 global aerospace and defence (A\&D) companies from six countries and three continents using quantile-based models and daily data from August 23, 2010, to July 1, 2022. The results show that both return and volatility spillovers vary over time, and those estimated at normal market conditions, intensify during COVID-19 and Russia-Ukraine war periods. Spillovers of returns estimated at lower and upper quantiles exceed those estimated at the middle quantile. Volatility spillover is extremely high at the upper quantile and exhibits low variability. Chinese defence stocks are segmented from the rest under normal return conditions and a moderate volatility state. In contrast, they are somewhat integrated under extreme return conditions and volatility states. Hence, Chinese defence stocks entail more diversification benefits under normal conditions than in bear or bull markets. Further analysis shows that geopolitical risk consistently plays a significant role in driving both returns and volatility spillovers, especially during the pandemic and war periods, without ignoring the role of macroeconomic and financial variables. These results have implications for investors concerned with stock portfolio management under various return and volatility conditions and for policymakers preoccupied with policy design under unstable periods}},

  abstract={Time series anomaly detection plays a critical role in various applications, from finance to industrial monitoring. Effective models need to capture both the inherent characteristics of time series data and the unique patterns associated with anomalies. While traditional forecasting-based and reconstruction-based approaches have been successful, they tend to struggle with complex and evolving anomalies. For instance, stock market data exhibits complex and ever-changing fluctuation patterns that defy straightforward modelling. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called TDSRL (Time Series Dual Self-Supervised Representation Learning) for robust anomaly detection. TDSRL leverages synthetic anomaly segments which are artificially generated to simulate real-world anomalies. The key innovation lies in dual self-supervised pretext tasks: one task characterises anomalies in relation to the entire time series, while the other focuses on local anomaly boundaries. Additionally, we introduce a data degradation method that operates in both the time and frequency domains, creating a more natural simulation of real-world anomalies compared to purely synthetic data. Consequently, TDSRL is expected to achieve more accurate predictions of the location and extent of anomalous segments. Our experiments demonstrate that TDSRL outperforms state-of-the-art methods, making it a promising avenue for time series anomaly detection.},

abstract = {{With the advent of Big Data, managing large-scale portfolios of thousands of securities is one of the most challenging tasks in the asset management industry. This study uses an evolutionary multi-objective technique to solve large-scale portfolio optimisation problems with both long-term listed and newly listed securities. The future returns of long-term listed securities are defined as random variables whose probability distributions are estimated based on sufficient historical data, while the returns of newly listed securities are defined as uncertain variables whose uncertainty distributions are estimated based on expertsâ€™ knowledge. Our approach defines security returns as theoretically uncertain random variables and proposes a three-moment optimisation model with practical trading constraints. In this study, a framework for applying arbitrary multi-objective evolutionary algorithms to portfolio optimisation is established, and a novel evolutionary algorithm based on large-scale optimisation techniques is developed to solve the proposed model. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms in large-scale portfolio optimisation.}},
